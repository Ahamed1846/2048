# 🎮 2048 Game

A classic 2048 puzzle game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no libraries, just clean vanilla code. Combine tiles, strategize your moves, and try to reach the 2048 tile!

## 🧩 Gameplay Overview

**2048** is a sliding block puzzle where the goal is to combine numbered tiles to create a tile with the number **2048**.

- Move tiles using arrow keys (← ↑ → ↓)
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they **merge** into one
- After every move, a new tile (2 or 4) spawns in a random empty spot
- The game ends when:
  - You create a tile with **2048** — _you win_
  - No more valid moves remain — _game over_
